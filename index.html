        <h1><strong>ABOUT ME:</strong></h1><br
        
       <p> Hello and welcome! My name is <strong>Jeevan Varma R</strong>. I., and I am delighted to share a bit about my
         journey, ambitions, and aspirations. I am currently a first-year student pursuing a<em>Bachelor of
         Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AI & DS)</em>.
         My academic journey began at<em> Bharathi Metric Higher Secondary School</em>, Vijayamangalam, where I completed
         my schooling. My education there provided me with a strong foundation in critical thinking and problem
         -solving, preparing me for the challenges of higher education.</p><br

         <p>
            I reside in <em>Perundurai</em>, a serene town in Tamil Nadu, which I proudly call home. However, my roots lie 
            in <em>Kerala</em>, a place deeply connected to my identity and values. Growing up in these culturally rich and 
            diverse environments has shaped my outlook on life, instilling in me the importance of balance, hard work,
            and continuous self-improvement.
         </p><br
         <p>
            When I am not immersed in academics, I dedicate my time to pursuing my hobbies, which are more than just activities
            they are a part of who I am. I have a deep passion for playing cricket, a sport that teaches me the value of teamwork
            ,discipline, and perseverance. Additionally, I enjoy video editing, which allows me to combine creativity with technical
             skills, transforming simple visuals into compelling narratives. It’s a field where I continuously explore new techniques,
              and I am currently venturing into the world of VFX, learning the art of creating stunning visual effects.
         </p><br
